# Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/tree/HEAD)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/compare/v0.4.0...HEAD)

## New `validate` CLI command

A new CLI command (`validate`) has been added to make it possible to validate entities.
This is convenient both as a split of the bloated `upload` command implementation, but also as a separate functionality for data documentation repositories to ensure any changes to entities will still result in valid entities.

Furthermore, a new `--auto-confirm/-y` option has been added to the `upload` command as an extension on the `--quiet/-q` option. It will still ensure print statements occur, but will use defaults and "Yes" responses whenever it is needed.

**Implemented enhancements:**

- ‚ú® Add an option to the `upload` command to auto-confirm the summary [\#119](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/issues/119)

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/tree/v0.3.0) (2024-04-09)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)

## CI/CD-friendly CLI

The CLI now supports setting an access token to upload entities - this avoids the need for manual interaction when authenticating using GitLab. The access token should preferably be case-specific and created as a group access token (see the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) for more information about group access tokens).

> Note, the minimum access level for the token should still be `Developer` for it to be allowed to create entities.
> Beware that this minimum access level may change in the future.
# Support specific namespaced URIs

Support specific namespaced URIs according to #7. If one has write rights for the entity backend, by setting the `namespace` and/or `uri` value in the entity files, they will use the relevant namespace, either the core namespace or a specific namespace.

## UX/DX updates

Otherwise, the code has had some clean up related to entity model definitions, separating out the SOFT flavorings. Some fixes have been implemented after first tests have been run "in production".

**Implemented enhancements:**

- üîê Support supplying access token to upload [\#108](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/issues/108)

**Fixed bugs:**

- An access token is not tested properly in the service [\#112](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/issues/112)

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/tree/v0.1.0) (2024-01-31)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/compare/v0.0.1...v0.1.0)

This is the first "proper" release (after v0.0.1).

It introduces several steps up compared to a bare-bones REST API service that started as a way to return the entities from the URI/URL they have defined. Specifically on the onto-ns.com domain under the `/meta` path.

The main upgrade revolves around the CLI, implemented to facilitate uploading entities.
It does so by connecting to the REST API service, authenticating via SINTEF's GitLab OAuth2 flow.

A PyPI release is not planned yet. To install this package run (in a virtual environment):

```console
pip install "entities-service[cli] @ git+https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service.git"
```

Then run:

```console
entities-service --help
```
